## First Verse 

He thought he saw an Elephant

That practised on a fife:

He looked again, and found it was

A letter from his wife.

"At length I realize," he said,

## Second Verse

I have wished a bird would fly away,

And not sing by my house all day;

Have clapped my hands at him from the door

When it seemed as if I could bear no more.

The fault must partly have been in me.


## Third Verse
"The sun was shining on the sea,

Shining with all his might:
      
He did his very best to make

The billows smooth and bright —
      

## Last Verse


In the quiet hush of morning light,

Where dawn unveils its soft embrace,

The world awakens from the night,

In hues of gold and tender grace.

The trees, they whisper ancient tales,

Of sunlit days and starry skies,

Their leaves like ships with silken sails,

Drift softly through the dawn’s surprise.

The brook hums low a gentle song,

Its melody a fleeting dream,

As shadows stretch, then fade, then long,

And daylight paints the world a gleam.

The flowers blush in shades anew,

Their petals kiss the warming air,

And all around, the colors brew

A tapestry beyond compare.

In every breath and fleeting glance,

The world’s a canvas, bright and grand,

And we, like artists in a trance,

Are touched by nature’s guiding hand.
